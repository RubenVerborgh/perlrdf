RDF-Base version 0.0.1

RDF::Base provides base classes and an API for working with RDF in Perl.
This includes classes for RDF Nodes (RDF::Node), RDF Statements
(RDF::Statement), RDF Storage backends (RDF::Storage), and collections of
RDF patterns used for query support (RDF::Pattern).


To use the Node and Statement classes, here's an example of how to construct
the following N3 triple: [ foaf:name "greg" ]

  $subj      = RDF::Node::Blank->new();
  $pred      = RDF::Node::Resource->new( uri => "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name" );
  $obj       = RDF::Node::Literal->new( value => "greg" );
  $statement = RDF::Statement->new( subject => $subj, predicate => $pred, object => $obj );
