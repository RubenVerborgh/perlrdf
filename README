The Perl RDF project aims to be a pure-perl RDF framework implementation with an
emphasis on extensibility, API stability, and the presence of a test suite.
Currently, the project includes:

  * RDF::Query, a SPARQL (and RDQL) query engine supporting RDF::Redland,
    RDF::Core, and RDF::Store.
  * RDF::Trine::Parser - A native parser for RDF/XML and Turtle.
  * RDF::Trine::Store::DBI, an RDF Store for MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite, based
    on the Redland schema.
  * RDF::Trine::Iterator, iterator classes for variable bindings and RDF
    statements, used by RDF::Trine::Store, RDF::Trine::Model, and RDF::Query.
  * RDF::Trine::Namespace - A convenience class for easily constructing RDF node
    objects from URI namespaces.
  * RDF::Endpoint - A SPARQL endpoint based on RDF::Query.
